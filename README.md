## Project Overview

StockMetrics is a Predictive Analytics dashboard designed to make investing easier for beginners.

Learning how to invest can feel overwhelming. New investors are hit with unfamiliar terms (e.g., *dividends*, *dollar-cost averaging*, *volatility*), countless strategies and overcomplication, which often leads to **analysis paralysis** and ultimately deciding not to invest at all.

StockMetrics exists to cut through the noise and help users to capitalise on their most valuable asset: their time.

The goal is to turn **clueless users into confident investors in five minutes or less** by providing:

- a clear explanation of the purpose of the app.
- simple investing principles to anchor decision-making.
- a small, carefully-chosen set of stocks/funds to keep the experience focused.
- risk-based portfolio “plans” and forecast ranges to help users understand uncertainty.

### Core Investing Principles

StockMetrics reinforces three beginner-friendly principles:

- **Start early:** to benefit from compound growth over time.
- **Think long-term:** time in the market beats timing the market.
- **Diversify:** spread exposure across companies and sectors to help mitigate risk.

### Four Risk-Based Plans

To keep the learning curve low, StockMetrics focuses on well-known index funds and large blue-chip companies. Users can explore four portfolio plans based on risk tolerance:

- **Diversified (Low Risk):** 100% All-World fund
- **Targeted (Moderate Risk):** 100% S&P 500 fund
- **Concentrated (High Risk):** 75% S&P 500 fund + 25% Magnificent Seven
- **Aggressive (Higher Risk):** 50% S&P 500 fund + 25% Magnificent Six + 25% Tesla

Risk levels in StockMetrics refer to how concentrated a portfolio is within the stock market. All plans are equity-based and may experience significant short-term volatility.

StockMetrics includes brief explanations of the funds/companies and (where applicable) a short description of the “Magnificent Seven”, so users understand what they are looking at.

### Forecasts Over Time

StockMetrics provides predicted price outcomes over multiple time horizons:

- 1 year
- 2 years
- 5 years
- 10 years
- 20 years
- 50 years

To reflect uncertainty and volatility, predictions are presented as a range of scenarios:

- **Optimistic**
- **Realistic**
- **Pessimistic**

The four plans are calibrated to be **comparable and easy to switch between**. Users can move from a lower-risk plan to a higher-risk plan as their confidence grows, or from a higher-risk plan to a lower-risk plan if their risk-aversion grows, without completely changing the overall structure of the portfolio.

Ultimately, StockMetrics is designed to be a stepping stone: users can later customise their portfolio or explore other companies and sectors, but StockMetrics helps them start sooner - with clarity and confidence.
